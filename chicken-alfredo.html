<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This creamy chicken alfredo pasta combines tender grilled chicken with fettuccine noodles in a rich, homemade alfredo sauce. It's a restaurant-quality dish you can easily make at home.</p>
<p>The key to a silky smooth alfredo sauce is using freshly grated Parmesan cheese and slowly incorporating it into the cream mixture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound fettuccine pasta</li>
  <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
  <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Season chicken breasts with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
  <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, until fully cooked. Remove from pan, let rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>In the same skillet used for the chicken, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Add heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Reduce heat to low and gradually whisk in Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
  <li>Add cooked pasta to the sauce and toss until well coated.</li>
  <li>Add chicken strips on top and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately with additional grated Parmesan if desired.</li>
</ol>
